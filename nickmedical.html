            <h4>EEG</h4>
            <div style="margin-left:40px">
                I had one multi-day at-home EEG in 2022 but it showed no signs of seizures nor did I experience or try to trigger an incident.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Details</h3>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            I have a history of minor head trauma but not that much really.
            <br>I believe I was either born with the cavernoma or it was a result of a sports accident when I was 8.
            <br>I have a number of Trigeminal Nerve symptoms as well as migraine/cluster headaches on the same side of my head as the cavernoma.
            <br>An epileptologist tried treating me with 100 mg/day Lacosamide for 6 months.  It reduced my sensitivity to triggering seizures but it did not eliminate them.
            <br>I have been seen by many neurologists but I have never been officially diagnosed with a cerebral cavernous malformation except recently by Dr. Yot Navalitloha, a neurosurgeon at Bumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok.
        </div>

        <h3>Are They Really Focal Seizures?</h3>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            I don't know.
            <br>The symptoms feel like concussion symptoms but possibly because when I thought I was having concussions I was actually having focal seizures.
            <br>I have had only one EEG.  It did not show any indication of epilepsy but I did not experience any incidents nor did I try to trigger them.
            <br>My incidents come on suddenly, they are exacerbated by sleep deprivation and are usually triggered by smalls bumps or accelerations to my head.
            <br>The symptoms peak more or less immediately and slowly dissipate over several days or weeks.
            <br>During this time I have no physical, visual, or auditory impairment or anomalies but I have profound cognitive impairment; I cannot focus, think, or remember things normally so I cannot work.

                I sometimes smoke/ingest cannabis.  It has a very positive effect on my symptoms.  It reduces my Trigeminal Nerve symptoms and makes my head feel symmetric.  Normally my head does not feel symmetric but rather swollen on the left side.

            <h4>"Incidents"</h4>
            <div style="margin-left:40px">
                I have approximately 4-8 <text style="color:orangered; font-weight:bold">incidents</text> a year which are possibly <text style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">focal seizures</text>.
                <br><br>The <text style="color:orangered; font-weight:bold">incidents</text> are initiated by tiny bumps or accelerations to my head, also changes in blood pressure, such as putting my head below my waist.
                
                
                <h4>Symptoms of the "Incidents"</h4>
                <div style="margin-left:40px">
                    The symptoms of the <text style="color:orangered; font-weight:bold">incidents</text> feel like a concussion but that may only be because I had a head trauma in the past and triggered the cavernoma and mistook the symptoms for a concussion!  
                    
                    <br><br>Specifically the symptoms of the incident are:
                    <div style="margin-left:40px">
                        <br>1) An initial physical feeling of pressure or tension near my left ear concurrent with a small head acceleration or blood pressure shift.
                            
                        <br><br>2) Followed by confusion, brain fog, disorientation, really badly losing track of time, inability to make or follow plans, and an inability to remember or engage with what I had been doing immediately before or days prior to the incident, an overall drop in IQ and cognitive function.  Basically like I had instantly drank two or three beers, but not fun at all.  It's not subtle.
                    </div>
                    <br><br>e.g. In 2021 I was working as a software engineer and succeeding at my job, designing and programming a complex biotech laboratory automation system.  I worked extra hard for a fews days, slept poorly for one night, and woke up feeling haggard but still able to perform my job normally.  While driving to work I drove over a speed bump a little too fast and by the time I got to work I could no longer perform my job or remember

            <h4>Initial Head Trauma</h4>
            <div style="margin-left:40px">
                When I was 8 years old my brother accidentally hit me in the face with a baseball bat.  The main impact was to my left cheek directly in front of where I have the region of magnetic susceptibility.

            <h4>Progression</h4>
            <div style="margin-left:40px">
                Since the age of 21 my sensitivity to triggering an incident has gone way up.  A number of factors may have contributed to the worsening of my condition including minor head traumas and periods of stress and sleep deprivation.

            <h4>Trigeminal Nerve Symptoms</h4>
            <div style="margin-left:40px">
                I am have a littany of unusual symptoms on the left side of my face and around and inside my left ear, including feeling of fullness, pressure, very high-pitched tinnitus and overall asymmetry with regards to the right side of my head.

            <h4>Migraine/Cluster Headaches</h4>
            <div style="margin-left:40px">
                Sometime after getting hit in the head with a baseball bat at age 8 I started experiencing headaches that included intense pain behind my left eyes, sinus pressure on the left side, nausea, and vomiting.  Headaches were usually triggered by not eating, dehydration, altitude, and certain foods.  I successfully treated my headaches with Excedrin Migraine.

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        I experience concussion-like symptoms from almost infinitesimal impacts or accelerations to my head.  The symptoms come on immediately and take several days to subside.  Sleep does not make my symptoms go away.  One neurologist suggested these incidents could be focal seizures.<br>
        
        <br>
        My susceptibility to these incidents is greatly increased by sleep deprivation, cognitive exhaustion (such as working at my old job as a computer programmer), caffeine, alcohol, and possibly vitamin D deficieny.<br>
        
        <br>
        I have tried taking Lacosamide for six months (100 mg/day).  I believe this improved my condition somewhat but not completely. I was still able to trigger incidents under normal living conditions while taking 100 mg / day of Lacosamide.<br>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Head Traumas</h3>
        I have had several sports-related head traumas but never any severe head trauma like a car accident.  I have never lost consciousness.<br><br>
