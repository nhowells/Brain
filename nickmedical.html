        <h3>Illness</h3>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            I believe I have a <text style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">symptomatic cerebral cavernous malformation</text> in my left temporal lobe.
            <h4>"Incidents"</h4>
            
            <div style="margin-left:40px">
                I have approximately 4-8 <text style="color:orangered; font-weight:bold">incidents</text> a year which are possibly <text style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">focal seizures</text>.
                <br><br>The <text style="color:orangered; font-weight:bold">incidents</text> are initiated by tiny bumps or accelerations to my head, also changes in blood pressure, such as putting my head below my waist.
                <h4>Symptoms of the "Incidents"</h4>
                
                <div style="margin-left:40px">
                    The symptoms of the <text style="color:orangered; font-weight:bold">incidents</text> feel like a concussion but that may only be because I had a head trauma in the past and triggered the cavernoma and mistook the symptoms for a concussion!  
                    <br><br>Specifically the symptoms of the incident are:
                    
                    <div style="margin-left:40px">
                        <br>1) An initial physical feeling of pressure or tension near my left ear concurrent with a small head acceleration or blood pressure shift.
                            
                        <br><br>2) Followed by confusion, brain fog, disorientation, really badly losing track of time, inability to make or follow plans, and an inability to remember or engage with what I had been doing immediately before or days prior to the incident, an overall drop in IQ and cognitive function.  Basically like I had instantly drank two or three beers, but not fun at all.  It's not subtle.
                    </div>
                     <br><br>e.g. In 2021 I was working as a software engineer and succeeding at my job, designing and programming a complex biotech laboratory automation system.  I worked extra hard for a fews days, slept poorly for one night, and woke up feeling haggard but still able to perform my job normally.  While driving to work I drove over a speed bump a little too fast and by the time I got to work I could no longer perform my job or remember

            <h4>Trigeminal Nerve Symptoms</h4>
            <br><br>I am have a littany of unusual symptoms on the left side of my face and around and inside my left ear, including feeling of fullness, pressure, very high-pitched tinnitus and overall asymmetry with regards to the right side of my head.
            
            <h4>Migraine/Cluster Headaches</h4>
            <br><br>I lost my job as a software engineer because of this illness and cannot work.  I cannot work a full day in an office without making myself susceptible to triggering an incident doing normal everday activities.
            <br><br>I have no other major health issues, except I had major reconstructive surgery on my chest at age 15 to correct severe pectus excavatum.

        <h4>EEG</h4>
        I had one multi-day at-home EEG in 2022 but it showed no signs of seizures nor did I experience or try to trigger an incident.

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        I experience concussion-like symptoms from almost infinitesimal impacts or accelerations to my head.  The symptoms come on immediately and take several days to subside.  Sleep does not make my symptoms go away.  One neurologist suggested these incidents could be focal seizures.<br>
        
        <br>
        My susceptibility to these incidents is greatly increased by sleep deprivation, cognitive exhaustion (such as working at my old job as a computer programmer), caffeine, alcohol, and possibly vitamin D deficieny.<br>
        
        <br>
        I have tried taking Lacosamide for six months (100 mg/day).  I believe this improved my condition somewhat but not completely. I was still able to trigger incidents under normal living conditions while taking 100 mg / day of Lacosamide.<br>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Head Traumas</h3>
        I have had several sports-related head traumas but never any severe head trauma like a car accident.  I have never lost consciousness.<br><br>
